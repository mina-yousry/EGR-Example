## 📖 About the Article
Navigation in iOS can quickly become messy when all logic is placed inside a single massive router class.  
In the article, I introduce the **EGR Method (Enum Generic Router)**—a clean approach to handling routing in iOS apps using **Enums + Generics**.

The method ensures:
- ✅ Clear separation of responsibilities  
- ✅ Reduced boilerplate and repeated code  
- ✅ Strong typing with enums for possible routes  
- ✅ Dependency Injection ready (protocol-driven)

   Just double-click the `.xcodeproj` (or `.xcworkspace` if you add CocoaPods/SPM).

3. **Switch between branches**  
   - Start with the **`start`** branch to see the “massive router” version:  
     ```bash
     git checkout start
     ```
   - Move to the **`end`** branch to see the **final EGR solution**:
